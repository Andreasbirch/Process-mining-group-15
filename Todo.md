Prerequisites:

0. Read thesis
1. Fill out gaps in data specified by thesis
2. Find the combination of recordingid and processid (Written somewhere in thesis). Cool stuff about how they are combined
3. Find out how many processId for each recording
4. Try and look at everything separately, every caseId separately

DCR, Declaretive. Rum(Rule Miner) and Declare4py

# First iteration


- [] Data preprocessing.


- [] Modeling Alpha Alg.

- [] Conformance Checking, K-folds


Case ID = Recording ID
Activity = concatenate(Application/Process Name) (maybe)
Timestamp = Timestamp

Next.
Split according to connectors
