## Microsoft RPA
This repository contains the code and data utilized in our process mining project course (02296) at DTU. The investigation undertaken aimed to address the following research questions, in which we investigate the possible usecase of process mining techniques to make a recommender system.

1. How applicable are the Inductive, Inductive Infrequent, Heuristic (and Declarative) process miners in recommending connectors, and is there a key difference between imperative and declarative miners?

2. Is it possible to automate processes by selecting the best process connectors through conformance checking?

3. Is it viable to use conformance fitness values to recommend the top-k best connectors?

### Tech stack
Throughout our exploration the following libraries were used for format, model and validate the data.

* [PM4PY](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/static/assets/api/2.7.8/index.html "PM4PY's Documentation")
* [Pandas]( https://pandas.pydata.org/ "Pandas Documentation")
* [Scikit]( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "Scikit Documentation")
* [Disco]( https://fluxicon.com/disco/ "Disco Documentation")
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

# Methodology
The methodology employed in this project embraced an iterative process, continuously cycling through stages like planning, design, development, and evaluation within the context of process mining. Starting with a data set, each iteration involved spiraling through these stages until satisfactory answers were obtained or new questions emerged.

# Code
The project is split into numerous folder of each iteration, in which Preprocessing, Process Discovery and Conformance checking has occured.

# Results and Presentation
The results presented in the report can be seen through this link to our excel sheet, and non formatted in the .csv files found throughout or iterations
